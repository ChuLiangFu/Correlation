## V1.0 rc 2

- Added configure and Makefile.in, generated with GNU autotools.
- If the standard configure, make, make install procedure fails,
  the old Makefile is included as Makefile.old and is recommended
  to be renamed to Makefile and use the command: make all.
- AUTHORS and Changelog files now included.
